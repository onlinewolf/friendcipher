# FriendCrypt
Public and new cryptography for C++ and Java, [C++ Doxygen here](https://onlinewolf.github.io/friendcrypt/cpp/doxygen/html/index.html). (Now it use: SHA-3 (Keccak))
 - Powerful Random Number Generator (Rng), recommended: 384 bit
 - Powerful list/array shuffle with Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle and Rng, recommended: 384 bit
 - Symmetric key encryption with "unlimite" key and IV size (>=128 bit), recommended: 384 bit

Description:
- Is this slower than AES? Yes. (if the hash is Keccak.)
- Was it created for the future? Yes.
